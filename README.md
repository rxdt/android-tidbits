tidbits
===============

Building a collection of bits of useful code in Android/Java ... and beyond!

- idle_tracker creates a background service in an Android device to track idle or active time, and to detect when a user touches the screen. 

- src contains some calculators, written in Java.

- Other folders are exercises from exercism.io where I'm learning Ruby.
